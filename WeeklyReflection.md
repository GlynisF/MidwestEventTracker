# Weekly Reflection

___
### Week 1
*August 28, 2023*

I wasn't able to get a school rented laptop until the end of the week / beginning of my work week. I signed up for Slack
and looked into the upcoming assignment's for the week.

**Total hours: 3**

___
### Week 2
*September 4, 2023*

Had a lot of configuration issues this week that spanned over multiple days. Had a lot of issues with the VM as well,
but finally got things sorted out on a school rented laptop! The only other setback were the many admin password prompts
I received when downloading software. Overall, I think the config issues I experienced were a great learning process.

**Total hours: 35** 

___
### Week 3
*September 11, 2023*

I spent most of this week playing catch-up. I never ran into any major issues or setbacks. No Indie


**Total hours: 30**

___
### Week 4
*September 18, 2023*

I created the User table, Database, User and UserDao classes. I created a 'user sign up' jsp as well. 
Most of my time spent on work this week went towards the weekly content and assignments. I didn't get as much done this
week as I wanted to-- work took it out of me. I am too old to be on my feet for so long + working until bar time :`)

**Total hours: 20**

___
### Week 5
*September 25, 2023*
Time got past me a little / the weather change has been an adjustment, so my motivation hasn't been the greatest. I spent
most of my time this week on the weekly assignments and videos and didn't do enough for my project.

**Total hours: 20**

___
### Week 6
*October 2, 2023*
This week I implemented CSS / a theme to my project. I finished up unit testing for the User class.
I decided to change my User database up a little bit and had to rework my testing. I had to work all weekend
and wasn't able to get the things done that I had originally intended. I was done with the coding part of things,
but had to finish up my screen design files etc. I got a little caught up in the screen design part and thinking more
about how I wanted my site to look and act, so I didn't want to turn in something that felt rushed.

**Total hours: 30**
___
### Week 7
*October 9, 2023*
I have some catching up to do with weeks 5-7, but I am feeling good and excited to see what I am able to build in the
next coming weeks. I spent too much time on the design portion / presentation of my current working webpages.
Here on out I am going to worry about that later! I spent this week making sure my design files, project plan, classes
etc. are good to go and am going to spend this week getting up to speed.
