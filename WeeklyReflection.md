# Weekly Reflection

___
### Week 1
*August 28, 2023*

I wasn't able to get a school rented laptop until the end of the week / beginning of my work week. I signed up for Slack
and looked into the upcoming assignment's for the week.

*Total hours: 3*

___
### Week 2
*September 4, 2023*

Had a lot of configuration issues this week that spanned over multiple days. Had a lot of issues with the VM as well,
but finally got things sorted out on a school rented laptop! The only other setback were the many admin password prompts
I received when downloading software. Overall, I think the config issues I experienced were a great learning process.

*Total hours: 35*

### Week 3
*September 11, 2023*

I spent most of this week playing catch-up. I never ran into any major issues or setbacks. No Indie


*Total hours: 30*

___
### Week 4
*September 18, 2023*

I created the User table, Database, User and UserDao classes. I created a 'user sign up' jsp as well. 
Most of my time spent on work this week went towards the weekly content and assignments. I didn't get as much done this
week as I wanted to-- work took it out of me. I am too old to be on my feet for so long + working until bar time :`)

*Total hours: 20*

___
### Week 5
*September 25, 2023*
Time got past me a little / the weather change has been an adjustment, so my motivation hasn't been the greatest. I spent
most of my time this week on the weekly assignments and videos and didn't do enough for my project.

*Total hours: 20*

___
### Week 6
*October 2, 2023*
This week I implemented CSS / a theme to my project. I finished up unit testing for the User class.
I decided to change my User database up a little bit and had to rework my testing. I had to work all weekend
and wasn't able to get the things done that I had originally intended. I was done with the coding part of things,
but had to finish up my screen design files etc. I got a little caught up in the screen design part and thinking more
about how I wanted my site to look and act, so I didn't want to turn in something that felt rushed.

*Total hours: 30*
___
### Week 7
*October 9, 2023*
I have some catching up to do with weeks 5-7, but I am feeling good and excited to see what I am able to build in the
next coming weeks. I spent too much time on the design portion / presentation of my current working webpages.
Here on out I am going to worry about that later! I spent this week making sure my design files, project plan, classes
etc. are good to go and am going to spend this week getting up to speed.

*Total hours: 35*

___
### Week 8
*October 16, 2023*
This week I did some catching up with the weekly material & assignments. I was able to implement the weekly material / lessons directly into my project-- killing 2 birds with one stone.

I created a bi-directional relationship for my project and used Hibernate associations to establish the relationship 
between entities. The relationship was a one-to-many (User table)  with a many-to-one (Notebook table). I was successful in terms of retrieving data from both entities and displaying the data on a jsp.  The last big modifications made to my project/classes was creating a generic DAO, modifying existing tests to work with the GD and creating unit tests for the Notebook entity.

Finally, I dove into the AWS and created an ElectricBeanstalk environment for my project. 
It took me a while to get the configuration right, but was able to figure it out. I connected the AWS db with my project + MySQL Workbench, filled it with data from my remote db's, and was able to display the data thru the Beanstalk environment.

*Total hours: 10*

___
### Week 9
*October 23, 2023*
Cognito was the biggest task I knocked out this week. I got a little stuck and couldn't get Cognito to work properly.
This led me to the Slack where I was able to find solutions due to other students having the same issue! Turns out Cognito is just very finicky and doesn't believe in CRUD???

*Total hours: 8*

___
### Week 10
*October 30, 2023*
I didn't work on my Indie project this week but did some lite team project work. I explored the SoapUI API / integrated
it into my project?? I broke my phone beyond repair on the
30th and spent most of this week getting phone things sorted out and neglected  school a little bit  :'c

*Total hours: 4*

___
### Week 11
*November 6, 2023*
This week the neglect continues. I was supposed to have my prof. development project turned in on the 6th, but
haven't had sufficient time to knock it out. I also haven't worked on my indie project. However, I did do a lot of work with my group. We spent a good chunk of time meeting up and working together this week. I plan on getting into gear
so I can finish the semester off strong!
