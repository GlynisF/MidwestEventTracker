## **Problem Statement**
Lacking access to resources could be seen as a setback. It could also be seen as a propellant for inspiration and to 
_do it yourself_-- something dance music promoters in the Midwest are no stranger to. 

_DIY_ culture in the Midwest stems mostly from lack of access to
- more "well known" venues & clubs
- access to popular artists / talent with recognizable names

Absence of venues / clubs means absence of funding for events from establishments. The majority of American dance music artists
are lesser, even unknown, which establishments see as a risk / loss. Without these resources, throwing events often 
times comes at a high cost-- sometimes the cost being totally or partially out of pocket.

**Technologies / methods used for event planning by dance music promoters in the Midwest**
- Google Docs
- Email
- Handwritten notes
- Social media messaging platforms
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
- Text messages

Most planning is handled on multiple platforms, resulting in a back-and-forth between apps to get pertinent information.
While these methods work, there is room for error, especially with communication. Midwest Event Tracker will provide 
an easy-to-access, one-stop-shop by giving user's a template to cover the event throwing basics.
  
Midwest Event Tracker is here to help smaller promoters elevate their event game. MET will allow its users stay 
organized, focused, and successful by providing a place to help with the logistical side of event throwing. 
User's will be able to track event details, budget, set goals, and plan smarter. 
Midwest Event Tracker wants to help its user's event visions become reality and execute goals by 
offering a way see the bigger picture -- with past, present, and future events all in one place.
